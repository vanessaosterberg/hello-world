# hello-world
Just another repository


Hi there! I've done a lot of stuff in GitHub before so this stuff is pretty easy to me. This reminds me that I have a capstone project to be working on today...I need to make a home page for an app we're creating. Huh, I wonder how we're going to apply all the right styling.
